# SocialNetwork

Welcome to the social network! This project was a college project in which we had to do a case study of the storage techniques which can be applied to the data of a social network.
Also, we had to check the amount of memory these techniques used. Apart from that we also had to check how much memory sparse and dense graphs required for both these techniques.
The input (of the network) was taken through a CSV file. I took the permission from my team members to open source the project.

The programmers involved were (lexicographically):-
Shubham Dobhal
Sonali Goel
Tushar Raturi
Vibhu Jugran
Vidit Rawat
